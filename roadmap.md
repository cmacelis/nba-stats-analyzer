## Project Milestones

### 1. Planning and Setup
- [ ] Define core features and app architecture.
- [ ] Set up the development environment (Python/JavaScript frameworks).
- [ ] Research and integrate an NBA stats API (e.g., NBA Stats API or ESPN API).

### 2. Core Features

#### Phase 1: Player Comparison
- [ ] Implement player search functionality.
- [ ] Build a stats comparison module (points, assists, rebounds, etc.).
- [ ] Display results in a user-friendly format (tables, basic charts).

#### Phase 2: Historical Data Analysis
- [ ] Integrate historical data for teams and players.
- [ ] Add filtering options (season, team, player, stats).
- [ ] Develop trend visualization using graphs.

#### Phase 3: Game Predictor
- [ ] Create a basic predictive model using historical and current data.
- [ ] Allow users to select teams for predictions.
- [ ] Display predicted outcomes and winning probabilities.

### 3. Advanced Features
- [ ] Enhance visualizations with interactive graphs (Plotly, Chart.js).
- [ ] Build an AI-powered analysis module for more in-depth insights.
- [ ] Add a fantasy basketball assistant to suggest trades and sleeper picks.

### 4. User Interface and Experience
- [ ] Develop a web-based frontend for accessibility.
- [ ] Optimize UI for mobile responsiveness.
- [ ] Include export options for reports (PDF, CSV).

### 5. Testing and Deployment
- [ ] Perform rigorous testing (unit, integration, user acceptance).
- [ ] Deploy the application on a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Vercel).
- [ ] Gather feedback for future iterations.

## Step-by-Step Development Process

Below is a simplified breakdown of how to implement each part of the project. Adapt as needed for your team or environment.

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning
1. **Create GitHub Repository**  
   - Initialize a new repo, clone locally, set up initial folder structure:
     ```
     /nba-stats-analyzer
       /frontend
       /backend
       /docs
       README.md
     ```
2. **Initialize Frontend and Backend**  
   - **Frontend**: Use Create React App or Vite with TypeScript.  
   - **Backend** (Flask example): Create a virtual environment, install Flask, and make a simple “Hello World” endpoint.
3. **Basic CI Integration**  
   - Set up GitHub Actions (or another CI tool) to run tests on every commit.
4. **NBA Stats API Setup**  
   - Research available APIs (NBA Stats API, ESPN, etc.).
   - Plan how you’ll store credentials, handle rate limits, etc.

### Phase 2: Database Integration
1. **Database Setup**  
   - Use PostgreSQL locally or a cloud-hosted solution.
2. **ORM Configuration**  
   - For Flask, install flask-sqlalchemy and psycopg2.  
   - Create data models (e.g., `Player`, `Team`, `PlayerStats`).
3. **Data Retrieval**  
   - Write scripts to ingest data from the NBA stats API and store in the database.

### Phase 3: Core Features
1. **Player Comparison**  
   - Implement a search endpoint (`/search`) and a comparison endpoint (`/compare`).  
   - Frontend: Create a form to pick players and display comparison results.
2. **Historical Data Analysis**  
   - Extend models to store historical data by season and team.  
   - Build filtering endpoints and display data via charts on the frontend.
3. **Game Predictor**  
   - Create a basic model using scikit-learn or another library.  
   - Expose a `/predict` endpoint and render predictions in the frontend UI.

### Phase 4: Advanced Features & UI Improvements
1. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Switch to Plotly for richer, interactive graphs.
2. **AI-Powered Insights**  
   - Explore deep learning models (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for more advanced predictions.
3. **Fantasy Basketball Assistant**  
   - Add features like trade suggestions or sleeper picks.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance
1. **Containerization** (Optional)  
   - Use Dockerfiles for both frontend and backend.
2. **Hosting**  
   - Deploy frontend to Vercel or AWS S3 + CloudFront.  
   - Deploy backend on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, or a similar service.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**  
   - Automate builds, tests, and deployments on merges to `main`.
4. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   - Integrate with services like CloudWatch, Datadog, or Sentry for error tracking.
5. **Feedback & Iteration**  
   - Collect user feedback, prioritize new features, and continuously improve.
